# Shopping Cart 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run: `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Technologies use: ReactJS (Hooks, Context, Router), SASS and Local Storage

First, it will display a bunch of images of products (of food in this case). When user hovers the photo, he/she can favor it by click heart icon on the left of photo. He/she can click + sign on the right of photo to add it to shopping cart. (Click icon  again will undo the state of photo)

In the cart page, user can see the list of products they put in shopping cart. He/she can remove a product buy click Delete icon which is next to the photo). If the use is happy with its order, (s)he can press/click button 'Place Order' to process. After 3 seconds, order will be placed and all items are in the cart will be clear out. (I know the real process of placing order is more complicate than I did in this project! I have not gone down that road yet)
